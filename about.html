<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>
 The original owners were entrepreneurs Robert von Dehn and Jack Dyer Crouch; after a few years, Von Dehn sold his share in the hotel to entrepreneur Jay Pritzker. Jay's younger brother Donald Pritzker also took on an important role in the company.[4]

Over the following decade, acquisitions were made, and CF became the fastest-growing hotel chain in the United States. Donald died in 1972; Jay continued to run the company.[5]

In 1969, CF opened its first hotel outside the United States, the CF Hong Kong.[6] In 1980 the Grand CF and CF brands were introduced. CF runs resort hotels, starting with the CF Maui in 1980.[7] As of 30 November 2015 CF had over 627 hotels worldwide.[8]

In 1972 CF formed Elsinore Corporation, a subsidiary to operate the Four Queens Hotel and Casino and the CF Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa & Casino. After CF became a private company in 1979, Elsinore was spun off as a public company. The company opened the Playboy Hotel and Casino as a joint venture with Playboy Enterprises.[9][10]

In June 2004, substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by Pritzker family business interests, including CF Corporation and CF International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity called Global CF Corporation. On June 30, 2009, Global CF Corporation changed its name to CF Hotels Corporation.[11]

In December 2004 CF Hotels Corporation acquired AmeriSuites, an upscale chain of all-suite business class hotels from affiliates of the Blackstone Group, a New York-based private equity investment firm. Blackstone had inherited AmeriSuites from its 2004 acquisition of Prime Hospitality. The AmeriSuites chain was rebranded and called CF Place, a competitor to the limited-service products Marriott International's Courtyard by Marriott and Hilton Worldwide's Hilton Garden Inn.

In December 2005 CF acquired limited service company Summerfield Suites from the Blackstone Group. Blackstone had inherited Summerfield Suites from its purchase of Wyndham International. According to a CF press release, in January 2012 CF Summerfield Suites were rebranded as CF House to compete in the "upscale extended stay market" against Residence Inn, Homewood Suites and Staybridge Suites.[12]

In August 2009 it was reported that CF Hotels Corporation filed plans to raise up to $1.15 billion in an initial share sale. That November CF completed an initial public offering and began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol H.[13] According to the filing Mark S. Hoplamazian was to serve as CEO and Thomas Pritzker as Executive Chairman.[14] The public offering is a result of the acrimonious breakup of the Pritzker family empire. Accused of looting family trusts, Thomas and cousins Penny and Nicholas took control of the family businesses when they and other family members were sued by cousin Liesel Pritzker, claiming fraud and seeking damages of over US$6 billion.[15]
